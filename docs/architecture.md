AIDE OS Architecture 
Overview
AIDE OS is a next‑generation AI operating system designed to treat AI not as an “application” but as an OS‑level capability.
It provides model‑agnostic execution, guaranteed safety, and device‑native control, enabling enterprises, governments, and research institutions to safely integrate multiple AI models with clear responsibility boundaries.

AIDE OS separates Reasoning from Execution, allowing organizations to build autonomous systems that remain safe, auditable, and controllable.

AIDE OS consists of three layers:

AIDE OS (Body Layer)
Core Functions
Device‑native control

Safety guardrails

Model‑agnostic execution layer

TRIT CORE (Three‑valued logic engine)

AGI Layer (Brain Layer)
Capabilities
Dynamic reasoning

Long‑term planning

Multi‑model integration

Self‑audit and self‑correction

ASI Layer (Mind Layer)
Roles
Meta‑governance

Intent alignment

Value‑system stabilization

Global optimization

1. AIDE OS (Body Layer)
AIDE OS functions as the “body” of the intelligence stack.
It is the layer that assumes execution responsibility for all AI models.

Key Components
TRIT CORE (Three‑Valued Logic Engine)
Logic values: True / False / Unknown

Handles ambiguity and uncertainty at the OS level

Prevents hallucinations and unsafe behavior by allowing the system to explicitly represent “I don’t know”

Model‑Agnostic Execution Layer
Supports OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft, local LLMs, and more

Provides a unified API regardless of model provider

Device‑Native Control
Works across PC, mobile, IoT, robotics, and cloud environments

Allows AI to operate devices with OS‑level authority while maintaining strict safety boundaries

Safety Sandbox
Permission separation

Pre‑execution validation

Full audit logging

Enables enterprises to define and enforce responsibility boundaries

2. AGI Layer (Brain Layer)
The AGI layer is the “thinking brain” built on top of AIDE OS.

Capabilities
Long‑term planning

Cross‑model reasoning

Self‑audit

Self‑correction

Unified memory

AGI can only exist on top of the safety guarantees provided by AIDE OS.

3. ASI Layer (Mind Layer)
The ASI layer represents meta‑governance, values, and intentionality.

Roles
Value alignment

Meta‑decision making

Global optimization

Self‑governance

Because the stack is built bottom‑up (AIDE OS → AGI → ASI),
safety is structurally guaranteed from the OS layer upward.

Why AIDE OS Matters
Enterprises can safely integrate multiple AI models

Governments can establish clear responsibility boundaries

Researchers gain OS‑level control over AI behavior

Perfectly aligned with Microsoft’s OS‑centric culture

Rebuilds the future of AI from the OS layer, not the application layer
